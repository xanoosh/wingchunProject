# wingchunProject

Project of wing chun kung-fu school site.

I used bootstrap 4 classes, so it's fully responsive. 
I also included J'query plugin for parallax scroll effect and a little animation of a yin-yang symbol (css) inside the dropdown menu.
This site has one page, menu elements are linked to content id's and scrolls to the chosen element(javascript).
I made background image by myself using photoshop and ilustrator ink and brush :) .

All in all, technologies used are html, css (sass, bootstrap), javascript (j'query).
